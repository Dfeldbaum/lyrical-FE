            <p>Tryin' to get control<br>
              Pressure's takin' its toll<br>
              Stuck in the middle zone<br>
              I just want you alone<br>
              My guessing game is strong<br>
              Way too real to be wrong<br>
              Caught up in your show<br>ads
              Yeah, at least now I know<br><br>
              It wasn't love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br>
              Mistaken for love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br><br>
              You were a perfect illusion<br>
              I don't need eyes to see<br>
              I felt you touchin' me<br>
              High like amphetamine<br>
              Maybe you're just a dream<br>
              That's what it means to crush<br>
              Now that I'm wakin' up<br>
              I still feel the blow
              But at least now I know<br>
              It wasn't love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br>
              Mistaken for love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br><br>

              It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me<br>
              Dilated, falling free<br>
              In a modern ecstasy)<br>
              (Where are you, 'cause I can't see you<br>
              It was a perfect illusion<br>
              (But I feel you watchin' me)<br>
              Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)<br>
              Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)<br>
              (But I feel you watchin' me)<br>
              Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)<br>
              Mistaken for love<br>
              In a modern ecstasy<br>
              In a modern ecstasy<br><br>

              I'm over the show<br>
              Yeah at least now I know<br><br>

              It wasn't love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br>
              Mistaken for love, it wasn't love<br>
              It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)<br>
              (Aah) you were a perfect illusion<br>
              (Aah) it was a perfect illusion<br>
              It was a perfect illusion<br>
              Somewhere in all the confusion<br>
              It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion)<br><br>

              It was perfect illusion<br>
              Somewhere in all the confusion<br>
              You were so perfect<br>
              You were a, you were a perfect illusion<br>
